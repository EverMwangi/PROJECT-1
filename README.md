# MEASURING SUCCESS OF A PRODUCT ON INSTRAGRAM
## solution
In the ever-evolving realm of social media, adaptation and innovation are vital for maintaining user engagement and satisfaction. Instagram, renowned for its creative and user-centric approach, introduced IGTV for long-form video content. As a Product Data Scientist at Instagram, evaluating IGTV's success is both thrilling and complex. To do so, it's imperative to define key performance metrics:
* Total Video Views: This metric indicates user engagement and IGTV's popularity among users, reflecting content consumption trends.
* Average Watch Time: Beyond views, it measures user dedication to IGTV content, revealing engagement and captivation.
* User Retention Rate: Tracking user retention over time is pivotal, with cohort analysis identifying trends.
* Growth in Content Creators: Attracting more creators diversifies content, showcasing IGTV's appeal.
* User Feedback and Sentiment Analysis: Understanding user sentiment through feedback and sentiment analysis unveils emotional connections and user satisfaction with IGTV content.

## DATA COLLECTION 
Gather data related to IGTV, such as user engagement, content views, retention, and other relevant metrics. done through;
a.APIs: Leverage Instagram's Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to gain access to user engagement data, user profiles, and content information. Instagram offers APIs to developers, granting access to specific data (subject to platform policies and permissions).
b. Event Tracking: Introduce real-time event tracking within the IGTV application to capture user interactions as they happen. This can be accomplished using analytics tools or custom systems for tracking user actions.
c. Data Pipelines: Create data pipelines that routinely collect and process data from various origins, ensuring data quality and coherence. These pipelines may encompass Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) procedures.
d. User Surveys: Administer regular user surveys within the IGTV app or via email to directly gather feedback and user preferences.
'''python
'''import pyforest
df = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')


## Data Preparation:

Data Cleaning: Start by cleaning the data to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This ensures that the data is of high quality and reliable for analysis.
Data Integration: Combine data from different sources, such as user interaction data, content data, user profile data, and ad revenue data, into a unified dataset.
 #### Handling missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)
#### Handling outliers (example: assuming 'views' column is in the data)
Q1 = df['views'].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df['views'].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
df = df[(df['views'] >= lower_bound) & (df['views'] <= upper_bound)]
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct EDA to gain an initial understanding of the data. Use summary statistics, data visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps), and correlation analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
#### Summary statistics
summary_stats = df.describe()
#### Histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['views'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Views')
plt.xlabel('Views')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
#### Correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
### Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
Determine the KPIs that are most relevant to measure the success of IGTV, such as user engagement metrics (views, likes, comments), user retention rates, ad revenue, and user feedback scores.
#### Assuming KPIs are calculated as aggregate values
user_engagement_metrics = df.groupby('user_id')[['views', 'likes', 'comments']].sum()
user_retention_rates = (df['user_retained'] / df['total_users']) * 100
ad_revenue = df['ad_revenue'].sum()
user_feedback_scores = df['feedback_score'].mean()
### Segmentation and Cohort Analysis:
Segment the data into different user groups based on demographics, behavior, or other relevant factors. Analyze these segments separately to understand how different user groups interact with IGTV.
Perform cohort analysis to track the behavior of groups of users over time, helping to identify trends and changes in user engagement and retention.
#### Sample user feedback
user_feedback = ["This is great! I love IGTV.", "The app is slow and frustrating."]
##Sentiment analysis
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

sentiments = []
for feedback in user_feedback:
    sentiment_score = analyzer.polarity_scores(feedback)
    sentiments.append(sentiment_score)

for feedback, sentiment in zip(user_feedback, sentiments):
    print(f"Feedback: {feedback}")
    print(f"Sentiment: {sentiment}\n")
    
## Data Analysis and Calculations
Now, let's shift our focus to the data analysis and calculations phase, building upon the data preparation and EDA steps.
### Calculate Key Metrics:
In this phase, we calculate key metrics that provide insights into IGTV's performance, such as total video views, average watch time, user retention rate, and growth in content creators.
### Calculate Total Video Views
total_views = df['Video_Views'].sum()
### Calculate Average Watch Time
average_watch_time = df['Average_Watch_Time'].mean()
### Calculate User Retention Rate
average_retention_rate = df['User_Retention_Rate'].mean()
#### Calculate Growth in Content Creators
content_creators = df['User_ID'].nunique()

## Data Visualization:
Visualizations play a critical role in understanding data trends. Here, we create a visualization to track user retention rates over time.
### Plot User Retention Rate over Time
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(df.groupby('Created_At')['User_Retention_Rate'].mean(), marker='o')
plt.title('User Retention Rate Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('User Retention Rate')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

## Harnessing the Power of A/B Testing
A/B testing is a formidable instrument in the toolkit of a Product Data Scientist. It empowers data-driven decision-making by enabling controlled experiments to evaluate the impact of changes or new features on IGTV's success. By conceiving well-structured experiments, gathering data, and rigorously scrutinizing the results, A/B testing guides product improvements and enhancements.

## Reporting and Communication
Data without interpretation and communication is mere numbers. A Product Data Scientist plays a pivotal role in sharing findings and insights with cross-functional teams, including product managers, designers, engineers, and executives. Utilizing data visualizations and clear, concise explanations facilitates informed decision-making and drives IGTV's evolution.

 ## Conclusion
Measuring the success of Instagram TV (IGTV) is a multifaceted journey that necessitates a deep understanding of user behavior, content engagement, and platform dynamics. By meticulously tracking these metrics, conducting A/B tests, and fostering effective communication, a Product Data Scientist at Instagram contributes to IGTV's continued growth and innovation.
As IGTV evolves and adapts to user preferences, the role of a Data Scientist remains instrumental in shaping its future. With a data-driven approach, IGTV can continue to captivate users and offer a unique platform for long-form video content in the ever-changing landscape of social media. # MEASURING SUCCESS OF A PRODUCT ON INSTRAGRAM
